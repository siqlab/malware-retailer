There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

10.3.3 Finite square well
Things get more complicated if we have a finite potential well. For future convenience, we’ll
let x = 0 be located at the center of the well. If we label the ends as ±a, then V (x) is given
by
V (x) = ½
0 (|x| ≤ a)
V0 (|x| > a).

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

10.3.3 Finite square well
Things get more complicated if we have a finite potential well. For future convenience, we’ll
let x = 0 be located at the center of the well. If we label the ends as ±a, then V (x) is given
by
V (x) = ½
0 (|x| ≤ a)
V0 (|x| > a).

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

10.3.3 Finite square well
Things get more complicated if we have a finite potential well. For future convenience, we’ll
let x = 0 be located at the center of the well. If we label the ends as ±a, then V (x) is given
by
V (x) = ½
0 (|x| ≤ a)
V0 (|x| > a).

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

10.3.3 Finite square well
Things get more complicated if we have a finite potential well. For future convenience, we’ll
let x = 0 be located at the center of the well. If we label the ends as ±a, then V (x) is given
by
V (x) = ½
0 (|x| ≤ a)
V0 (|x| > a).

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

10.3.3 Finite square well
Things get more complicated if we have a finite potential well. For future convenience, we’ll
let x = 0 be located at the center of the well. If we label the ends as ±a, then V (x) is given
by
V (x) = ½
0 (|x| ≤ a)
V0 (|x| > a).

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒
k = 0 =⇒ p = ¯hk = 0), which would violate the principle.

because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

10.3.3 Finite square well
Things get more complicated if we have a finite potential well. For future convenience, we’ll
let x = 0 be located at the center of the well. If we label the ends as ±a, then V (x) is given
by
V (x) = ½
0 (|x| ≤ a)
V0 (|x| > a).

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

10.3.3 Finite square well
Things get more complicated if we have a finite potential well. For future convenience, we’ll
let x = 0 be located at the center of the well. If we label the ends as ±a, then V (x) is given
by
V (x) = ½
0 (|x| ≤ a)
V0 (|x| > a).

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

10.3.3 Finite square well
Things get more complicated if we have a finite potential well. For future convenience, we’ll
let x = 0 be located at the center of the well. If we label the ends as ±a, then V (x) is given
by
V (x) = ½
0 (|x| ≤ a)
V0 (|x| > a).

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

10.3.3 Finite square well
Things get more complicated if we have a finite potential well. For future convenience, we’ll
let x = 0 be located at the center of the well. If we label the ends as ±a, then V (x) is given
by
V (x) = ½
0 (|x| ≤ a)
V0 (|x| > a).

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

10.3.3 Finite square well
Things get more complicated if we have a finite potential well. For future convenience, we’ll
let x = 0 be located at the center of the well. If we label the ends as ±a, then V (x) is given
by
V (x) = ½
0 (|x| ≤ a)
V0 (|x| > a).

There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒

gap between the energies grows as n increases. Note that the energies in the case of a string
are also proportional to n
2
, because although ω = ck ∝ n, the energy is proportional to ω
2
(because the time derivative in Eq. (4.50) brings down a factor of ω). So Figs. 2 and 3 both
apply to both systems. The difference between the systems is that a string has ω ∝
√
E,
where as the quantum mechanical system has ω ∝ E.
There is no n = 0 state, because from Eq. (18) this would make ψ be identically zero.
That wouldn’t be much of a state, because the probability would be zero everywhere. The
lack of a n = 0 state is consistent with the uncertainty principle (see Section 10.4 below),
because such a state would have ∆x∆p = 0 (since ∆x < L, and ∆p = 0 because n = 0 =⇒
k = 0 =⇒ p = ¯hk = 0), which would violate the principle.
10.3.3 Finite square well
Things get more complicated if we have a finite potential well. For future convenience, we’ll
let x = 0 be located at the center of the well. If we label the ends as ±a, then V (x) is given
by
V (x) = ½
0 (|x| ≤ a)
V0 (|x| > a).

This is shown in Fig. 4. Given V0, there are two basic possibilities for the energy E:

V=V0
