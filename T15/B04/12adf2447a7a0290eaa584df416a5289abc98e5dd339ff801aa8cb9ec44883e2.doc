MARKETING MANAGEMENT & STRATEGYSTUDENT NAME: Frank HuttonSTUDENT No: 20724414INDEX No: 5056120CENTRE: GREENFIELDS1. i. Guerilla marketing strategy refers to a 
surprising advertising strategy and with unconventional interactions to promote the products and services. Guerilla marketing strategy is publicity practices, low-cost 
marketing advertising, very much local target, and getting quick attention. Consumer research is a systematic process to understand the consumer's preferences, 
attitudes, motivations, buying behaviors of targeted consumers. Consumer research is the scientific process that improves the demand for the product by successfully 
observing and understanding the customer's practices. Consumer research keeps focusing on consumer trends with the help of a variety of data, direct interaction with 
customers, tracking company sales with the help of mathematical tools, and technique to understand consumer behaviors. Guerilla marketing strategy very instant and for 
short term attention but consumer research is a very wide concept and it has long term advantages to business and experts. Guerilla marketing keeps focusing on the 
local market but consumer research much large and focusing on a variety of customers and considering nations and also internationally. Consumer research work on 
scientific analysis of data and interpretation of information to produce and results that enhance the product's demand and consumers can get the products they are 
looking for but guerilla strategy is an advertising practice work for creating demand with the help of existing products in the markets. Consumer behavior is a 
scientific process that works for producing new concept and new products and service that fulfill the consumer's demand but guerilla strategy work for instant response 
from consumers.ii. Each and every product has a life cycle. Each product should go through this cycle. Manufacturers are investing huge amount of money in research and 
development activities and conducting market researches timely to check the impact of their product in different market conditions. Let us first identify how many 
stages are there for a product and what all are the different marketing mix separately. Product life Cycle. Every product pass through certain stages at different 
points of its life. They can be classified as below:•            Developmental Stage •           Introduction stage •    growth stage • maturity stage •           
Decline stage. Every product will definitely pass through the decline stage or it will face an end. This happens due to several factors like lack of proper market 
research, technological degradation, changing preferences of the consumers, and certain natural factors that are beyond the control of the manufacturers. Now let us 
get to know about the marketing mix. The marketing mix is the set of tactical marketing tools used by the company to produce a desired response from its target 
audience. It consists of everything that a company can do to influence the demand for its product. The four Ps of the marketing mix are: - a) Product b) Price c) Place 
d) Promotion Product is the good or service that the company is planning to provide to its target customers. The product must be designed in such a way that it meets 
the expectation of the customers. Aspect like quality, quantity, color, design, brand name, packaging, etc. come into play. Price is the value that the company fixes 
for the product. Credit terms, discounts, payment period, etc. will be given importance here, Place is very much important aspect because the company should ensure 
that there is a proper channel of distribution to reach the end customers. Lack of proper distribution channels can affect the total sales of the company. Lat is the 
promotion area. Here the company should find different ways to pump by the sales of its products using attractive advertisements and other campaigns. This area covers 
sales promotion, personal selling, etc. The effective marketing mix combines the four P's of the marketing mix. It is designed to meet the company's marketing 
objective and by delivering value to its customers. Next, we get into the main part of the question. What all are the different marketing strategies adopted by a 
company to boost its sales at different stage in the product's life.? The developmental stage is a phase of selecting an idea. The adequate marketing strategy that 
should be adopted by the firm is to conduct thorough research and get an idea about the consumer's expectations about the product, their taste, and preferences. Lack 
of adequate market research will lead to product failure. The next stage is the introduction stage. Here the product gets introduced to the market. The sales for the 
product will be very low during this time. The customers may not be aware of the product during this phase. The marketing expenses at the introduction stage will be 
very high because the company should undertake different strategies to create and image for the product. The company should take care of the distribution channels and 
should heavily invest in advertisements and other promotional activities. Growth Phases is a stage when the product get into the minds of large number of target 
audiences. The people will become familiar with the product. The marketing strategy should focus on product differentiation at this point of time.This will help the 
company to create a brand image and differentiate its product from that of the competitors. The maturity stage is a stage where the product gain over its competitors. 
It is the stage where the product yield maximum sales. The strategy that should be followed during this stage involves efforts to build customer loyalty, typical by 
giving special promotions and incentives to customers to switch from competitors brand. The company should surveillance the technology very closely and must be updated 
to changing technology. Last is the declining stage. The good life of the product decline at this stage. The marketing efforts to decline at this stage. This stage 
doesn't attract new customers but maintains loyal customers. The company at this stage try to reinforce the image of product and attempts to regenerating the sales. 
The company tries to maintaining the loyal by fulfilling their needs. Each and every product must undergo this cycle provide the time period of each period will be 
different. Adequate research and proper implementation of marketing strategy will help the company in gaining a lot from its product. Hence there is a great underlying 
relationship between the product life cycle and marketing mix strategies.2i(A)i)Knowledge of Accounting PracticesThe bookkeeping significant will, most likely, come 
out as comfortable with the GAAP, or the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. These standards are intended to normalize bookkeeping rehearses in organizations and 
enterprises across the United States. It is additionally critical to know about the administrative guidelines connected with corporate and public funds to guarantee

venture the board. In the event that you will plan charges, you will require a careful information on charge programming. Regardless of whether you are not planning

continuous gander at resources, liabilities and value). These assertions provide your association with a normal preview of its monetary wellbeing.2i(B)i)CompetencyMost 
importantly, bookkeeping experts are known for their particular information and abilities upheld by their bookkeeping capability. It is normal and expected that they 
will keep this information and abilities forward-thinking all through their vocations (undertaking ordinary proceeding with proficient turn of events - CPD) so they 
can constantly convey work of the greatest quality, as per bookkeeping guidelines and applicable regulations and guidelines.ii)Reliability and responsibilityGenuine 
experts plan ahead of time and never go up to client gatherings ill-equipped. They honor their responsibilities and can be depended upon to constantly take care of 
business - they convey what they said they would convey, and on time. Be that as it may, on the off chance that things are not going precisely to design, they don't 
search for pardons however give a valiant effort to return errands and tasks on target. In the event that missteps are made, they acknowledge liability regarding the 
part they played.iii)Honesty and respectabilityIndividual responsibility is firmly connected to trustworthiness and honesty, one more two principle of amazing skill.

If your youngster will not put on a coat, your kid feels cold. In the event that your kid will not eat, your youngster feels hungry.i)Related to the way of 
behavingRelated: If your kid tosses a toy, you remove the toy Not related: you send her to early bed.ii)Respectful towards the youngster and not include disgrace or

job. It is an organized procedure by which people learn knowledge skill and attitude for a definite purpose. The purpose of training is basically to bridge a gap 
between job requirements and present competence of an employee. It helps in improving the behavior and performance of a person. Below are the three training needs of 
for the teller (Elizabeth) Refresher Training-when existing training become obsolete due to lack of concentrations of an individual employee or due to the advancement 
of method and technique then employee have to be trained in the use of the technique or clarifying the ongoing technique. With the passage of time employee may forget 
some of the methods of doing work refresher training is designed to revive and refresh the knowledge and update the skills of the existing employee. b. Remedial

relationship in which a senior manager in an organization assumes the responsibility for grooming a junior person. Technical, interpersonal and political skills are 
generally conveyed in such a relationship from the more experienced person. A mentor is a teacher, spouse, counselor, developer of skills and intellect, host, guide, 
exemplar, and most importantly, supporter and facilitator in the realization of the vision the young person has about the kind of life he wants as an adult. The main 
objective of mentoring is to help an employee attain psychological maturity and effectiveness and get integrated with the organization. In a work situation, such 
mentoring can take place at both formal and informal levels, depending on the prevailing work culture and the commitment from the top management. Formal mentoring can 
be very fruitful, if management invests time and money in such relationship building exercises. These training could help Elizabeth to solve this issue as behaving 
immorally with the major customer of the bank can lead to the heavy losses or she could be terminated by her job as the bank would never want to lose the major 
shareholder rather than having a loss of job to its employee. ii)In this particular situation Elizabeth could be queried by the organization is well known that 
behavior depends upon circumstances and there are certain triggers, emotions which controls the individual behavior. If Elizabeth misbehave only once, then a warning 
was sufficient but if Elizabeth continues this and became habitual then termination may happen according to law. If the bank lost the customer, then bank could take 
strict action against Elizabeth May Marian could be charged with the fines. It is advisable to provide all the dues of the employee and help to find a new job. If 
possible, try to re-appoint provide a better training to deal with the customers. iii)It is important to deliver to best to the customers as it creates a positive 
impact on customer's mind. Service management includesservice culture, service quality, employee engagement and customer experience which is the key to success. The 
main barriers in achieving higher level of customer service are an emphasis on achieving short term goals, a lack of commitment and lack of training. This may only be 
improved by developing and building quality organizations that are outcome focus and customer centric. This includes several processes such as Offer 24/7 customer 
support to customers without any downtime this create a belief in the customer for easy accessing thebasic operations, by improving the overall customer experience by 
training frontline staff. Also include a customer journey map to see all the critical points when customer feels good about the service. This helps in filling the gaps 
in the customer service and to analyze the customer experience analytics. Expand the portfolio with risk management and human capital management and service management 
such as non-underwritten insurance policy. Developer a truly omnichannel customer experience as it would be easy to assume how attached people are to their mobile 
phones, banking is on trajectory to becoming entirely
